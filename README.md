# weather_api_airflow
I built and automated an ETL process that can extract current weather data from open weather map API, transform the data and load the data into an S3 bucket using Apache Airflow. Apache Airflow is an open-source platform used for orchestrating and scheduling workflows of tasks and data pipelines.
